👋 Welcome

A developer passionate about building things that solve real problems—not just at work, but also beyond office hours through personal projects and experiments.

Never bound to a single framework or technology, always choosing the right tool for the problem. This approach has led to hands-on experience across:

Backend: Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate), Python (Django, Flask), Node.js (Express)

Frontend Exposure: React, Lit

Deployment & DevOps: Docker, AWS, CI/CD pipelines

Loves debugging tough errors, optimizing systems, and brainstorming solutions late into the night—because the process of making something work is just as exciting as the result.

Comfortable taking applications from backend logic to full deployment, while bridging frontend integrations when needed.

📌 Highlights

Built and deployed production-grade systems in enterprise and personal projects.

Experience in designing search, filter, and optimized solutions with measurable performance improvements.

End-to-end understanding of software delivery—from development to deployment.
